# Guess the Number ðŸŽ¯
A simple Python guessing game.

## How it works
The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.  
You try to guess it, and the game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low until you find the correct number.

## How to run the game
1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your computer.
2. Download the `guess.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the folder containing `guess.py`.
4. Run the command:
   ```bash
   python guess.py
